You can fish and catch bugs, but only as long as they're on the same screen as the primary player (they are often much more spread out so there is only one at a time on the screen)The only saving grace is the fact that you can switch who the primary is by simply shaking the controllers. Otherwise this installment of animal crossing is vastly improved from the previous games, with better visuals, customisation and more quality of life improvements than i can count. In older animal crossing games i only found a couple hours of things to do per day, in New horizons there seems to be a plethora of activities to take part in with new activities opening up the more i play. The new ability to Terraform the landscape and really shape the island to my liking is a more than welcome addition and makes me feel like I'm really starting a little town of my very own!

If you are buying this to play with a friend, however, just keep the limitations of couch co-op in mind before you buy.

This creates a slower paced game and allows you as a player to take your time and let your little island grow organically with every decision you make. There are some complaining about island sharing with others on the same console but the fact is it makes the game better. Islands are sizable so there is plenty of space for everyone but most importantly this is a social game and multiple residents makes it easier to harvest and share resources which is ESSENTIAL to progression. All in all a wonderful game and highly recommended.… Expand",3/20/20

My wife has about 8 hours in the game, I have about 6.Sharing an Island thoughts:So far we both find it excellent and have had no issues with sharing an Island.  I should qualify the review by stating that I played the GameCube version extensively and put some 80 hours into the 3DS version so I haven't played all iterations of the game.  Still, I have no issues with two people sharing an island as long as the primary player initiates it so player 2, 3 and 4 aren't held back.I always enjoyed the shared experiences of animal crossing.  How one player would teach the computer characters specific words.  You and your siblings arguing over who ran over all the flowers.  Competing to get rare fossils first.  To me that was the fun of the game.  Personally, I think so long as you aren't a control freak this is more fun forcing multiple players into a shared space.Actual Game Review:I love it.  To anyone who has played the game before this is a natural progression.  If you feel you are ready for a new instalment it appears to have everything you would want.  If you haven't played before you need to be prepared for what the actual game is.  Professional reviews would describe it more articulately but it is a basic communication game.  This may sound like one of those mobile games where you have to play every few hours to harvest stuff and trade things but the design predates that genre by several years.  Animal Crossing is a game where you basically hang out on an island with NPC's who you chat with and just hang out.  They are like virtual friends.  They learn your speech and are happy to see you.  You gradually develop the island by changing the landscape and adding little customizations all around.  These are all small almost mindless tasks but it gives you a felling of touching up your home.  You can also visit friends islands which is much easier in the modern age of the internet than it use to be.  It is all fun in a passive sort of way.  The game is ideally played for around 15 to 30 min a day every day for years.  You do a few tasks and watch how the world changes with the seasons and holidays.  Slowly collecting things and changing the world.  I imagine some of the negative reviews are people trying to marathon the game because they are stuck inside due to the virus outbreak.  You can play for hours a day but that probably isn't the best way to enjoy things as the game clock is part of what drives progress.  If these things sound pleasant and fun you might like it.  Animal Crossing really is an acquired taste but I am happy to say that the format still has life left in it after all these years.… Expand",3/21/20

The DIY crafting mechanic allows you to build new items instead of buying them like in past game and offers new uses for existing material on your island. The characters are charming and have unique personalities that keep the game refreshing.,3/21/20

If you wanted multiple villagers, the second wasn’t mayor and didn’t have as much freedom. So I would say that this isn’t a step back, but rather a lack of step forward from the developers on that front. However I don’t believe that this condemns all the amazing other features and steps forward. All furniture has been remodelled with great details, textures and lighting effects for a game with such a simplistic artistic direction. The museum is sublime, and the hourly music is memorable (for some). Animals now do lots of activities too and feel more alive than ever with witty and varied dialogue. Crafting is simple but well implemented, and it is a pleasure to slowly build the island into the little village the previous games had gotten us used to. I am ready to take off two points for the limitations created for families/friends with one console, though it does not concern me personally, but that does not entirely condemn it for all the wonderful things it has to offer and the great effort that was put into designing the game. It can’t be enjoyed by all, but for those that are planning to play solo, go for it, there is so much to get out of this experience!!… Expand",3/22/20

I get why people are punishing the limitations of multiplayer cause it was one of the main things in every trailer/announcement and in some aspects it can be really poor. But I just can't understand all the 0/10, especially the ones saying it's like a HD New Leaf.Are we playing the same game? I've spend my last three days around my island in a 4K monitor and I think it's one of the prettiest games I've ever played. Every franchise has its style, you can't make this game with the details of Red Dead Redemption 2 because you could destroy what AC means: simple but cool relaxing folky ambients to spend your life on. New Horizons maintains the style of the saga with new and more detailed than ever graphics, amazing lightning and weather effects and the perfect acoustic soundtrack for a walk in the woods (plus a lot of new and reinvented features that combine very well with that deserted island in modern days feel of everything).It came out a few days ago and I don't get why some people are asking for big things at the very beginning of a game that's supposed to be played day by day for a very long time. In the third day around the island I had sooooo many things to do I really didn't know where to start. The way you can decorate everything step by step, and the way you feel when you finally unlock every little feature... I think it's the best AC ever made, or at least one of the great ones. And for all the missing characters and features for the fans like Brewster or the gyroids it's all coming soon with free updates.Maybe you're new and you were looking for a different experience, maybe you really didn't know it was limited to one island (which is a very bad point but it's not something Nintendo has tried to hide with this and any other past Animal Crossing game), or idk, maybe you want a Grand Theft Animal... What I'm just trying to say is that I believe this is a pretty good game that doesn't deserve all the hate it's receiving here. Just calm down. Times are getting very weird and this is the perfect game to stress out :)… Expand",3/22/20

Population: Growing had only one town per memory card. Wild World only had one town per cartridge. City Folk had only one town per system. And New Leaf had only one town per cartridge. Out of all the negative reviews on this site (142 at the time of this review), only about 20-30 of them have actual valid criticisms about the game.Now enough of that.This game is honestly a wonder to play, its truly amazing how unique and fun it is and is definitely a step up from its predecessors. The graphics and sound are phenomenal. The game play is amazing. The way the game just manages to just completely soothe you and take you away from your surroundings is completely mind boggling. It's almost like the game hypnotizes you, keeping you completely focused on whats going on in the game.The only reason I don't rate this a 10 is because some of the loading times do get rather excessive (40 seconds to load up the mailbox, however this was on only one occasion and I believe it was an isolated incident). Some of the progression is really weird and it took me a second to actually figure out what to do and unlock all the tools and whatnot. I am mildly disappointed that they don't let you explore the entirety of the island right away but I actually believe its necessary to help teach new players how to play the game before completely letting go of their hands and leaving them free to their devices. Also I do agree that the couch co-op does kinda suck in that its incredibly limiting for player 2. Don't listen to the 1 Island per Switch people, imo it isn't really a valid reason for rating the game a 0 out of 10 since its always been this way. Hope this helps!… Expand",3/22/20

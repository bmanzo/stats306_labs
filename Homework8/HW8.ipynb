As announced in an email, starting from this homework, please name your file correctly,  your file should end with .ipynb so that the GSI can open it without having to convert it to .ipynb from .json.  Also, you should print out all of your output. We will take off some points if you just provide your code without actually running it.  That is, we want to see the output of your code.\n"
